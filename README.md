# BlockShuffle for Spigot
A simple Block Shuffle game for Minecraft 1.17.1

Block Shuffle is a fun and easy game that you can play with your friends! Initially created by Dream and brought to 1.17 by me, enjoy racing against your friends to locate the blocks as fast as you can!

### How to play:
- A random block is given to each player in chat
- Players have the amount of time shown at the top of the screen to find and stand on their block
- If the player doesn't stand on their block in time, they are knocked out!
- The winners are the player(s) who completed the most rounds!
- Be careful! The longer the game goes on, the less time you have to find your block!

### Commands:  
- /blockshuffle start begins the game
- /blockshuffle stop ends the game early, game will stop automatically if someone wins
